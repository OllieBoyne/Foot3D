## Usage

High resolution foot scans for foot reconstruction tasks. We provide two datasets here:

- `Meshes`: High resolution, scanned 3D foot models [how many], as used in ['FIND: An Unsupervised Implicit 3D Model of Articulated Human Feet'](https://ollieboyne.github.io/FIND).
- `Multiview`: Scanned feet combined with calibrated camera images for reconstruction evaluation, as used in [FOUND: Foot Optimisation with Uncertain Normals for Surface Deformation using Synthetic Data](http://ollieboyne.github.io/FOUND)

## Download instructions

To download the latest dataset, please fill in this [Google form](https://forms.gle/7eZh67UXMZYcM11M7), and you will be emailed a download link. Make sure to select the correct option out of `Meshes` and `Multiview` to receive the correct link.

See [meshes.md](meshes.md) and [multiview.md](multiview.md) for details on the dataset setups, as well as how to cite the datasets if you use them in your research.
